# 6) C structs and functions

Today:
 1. Structs
 2. Functions

## 1. Structus
- We saw that arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the _same kind_
- `struct`s (or structures) are user-defined data type that allow to collect data items (members) of _different kinds_

### Definition
Pseudo-code:

```
struct[structure tag]
{
    member definition;
    ...
    member definition;

} [one or more structure variables]
```

## 2. Functions
